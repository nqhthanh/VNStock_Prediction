# VNStock Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
VNStock Prediction is a machine learning project designed to analyze and predict stock prices in the Vietnamese stock market. It leverages historical stock data and various predictive modeling techniques to provide insights into future stock trends.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Collection:** Fetches and preprocesses historical stock data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes trends, patterns, and correlations in stock prices.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts meaningful features to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements multiple models, including Linear Regression, LSTM, and other deep learning architectures.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compares model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.
- **Visualization:** Generates interactive plots to showcase predictions.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nqhthanh/VNStock_Prediction.git
